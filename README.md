Dyad 2 Child Theme to temporarily patch a menu bug

This child theme temporarily serves to rename the primary menu location.
Once the theme itself is updated, it will no longer be needed


##Update:
Dyad 2 has been patched with version 2.0.1, so this child theme is no longer needed. Install the latest version from https://wordpress.com/theme/dyad-2, or run the WP updater from your dashboard instead
